# Classification
In this project, I developed a binary classification model to predict whether individuals prefer mountains or beaches based on a dataset sourced from Kaggle. The dataset includes various features such as age, gender, preferred activities, and the distance from home, which all contribute to understanding personal preferences. The first step involved thorough data exploration, where I checked for missing values and examined the overall structure of the dataset. After identifying and addressing any null values, I converted categorical variables into numerical formats using appropriate encoding techniques. I then selected the relevant features and labels, scaled the features to ensure consistent data ranges, and built the classification model. Finally, I performed hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model's performance, allowing it to accurately predict individuals' preferences for mountains or beaches.
